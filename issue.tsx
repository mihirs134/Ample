        <i> TW: Mental Disorders and Suicide </i>
        While mental health awareness has progressed greatly over the past couple of years, awareness in terms of
        student mental health awareness has remained stagnant. However, teens
        are often the most susceptible to experiencing mental health issues. Big
        words?: On average, approximately 1 in 5 students meet the criteria to
        be diagnosed with mental illness by the time they turn 18 in the state
        of New Jersey. Mental health is not black and white, but rather a
        spectrum associated with a number of different factors. When surveying
        current high school students, it is found that the primary stressor is
        the vast amount of work needed to be done not only in class, but also
        outside of the classroom in terms of projects, homework assignments, and
        test preparation. Students often feel as though they lack control over
        the course of their lives, and lose the intrinsic motivation to finish
        their work. They also mentioned that the promotion of the letter grading
        system causes students to link their self-worth to their grades,
        worsening self-esteem and mental health issues. It is already incredibly
        hard to manage a mental health problem. When students have to
        incorporate the struggle into their daily schedules, there is an influx
        of stress creating a positive feedback loop; the stress keeps getting
        worse without avail. High school students are the highest group of teens
        to attempt suicide, with 8.9% of high school students in New Jersey
        attempting to take their own lives in 2019. This is a dangerous virus
        that plagues our nation, causing us to lose around 800 of our peers
        annually. The cost is too great for us to sit any longer.
