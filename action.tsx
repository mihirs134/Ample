        AmpleMH’s main goal is to spread awareness about the importance of
        mental health during one’s teens. On our Instagram (@AmpleMH), we try to
        promote healthy habits through spreading statistics and motivation to
        get people through the day. We’ve not only asked the students of what
        they thought about the issue, but we’ve also taken interviews with
        educative administration to find the best way to keep our peers safe and
        healthy in even the most competitive of environments.

        However, awareness isn’t always enough. We want to promote healthy
        mental hygiene across the board, which includes taking action. That’s
        why we’re currently in the process of developing a new app to best help
        you develop consistency in your healthy habits!{" "}
