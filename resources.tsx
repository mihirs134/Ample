        AmpleMH is an not organization meant to promote the mental hygiene of

        habits and a positive mindset!

      <p>
        When we started this project, we were still high schoolers facing the
        aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect it had on our
        well-being. While our school tried to make small changes (i.e. No
        Homework Nights, Mental Health Awareness Day) to promote better mental
        health, we could all notice that the changes being made werenâ€™t creating
        as much permanent change. Although New Jersey remains #1 In the country
        for mental health programs, the pandemic has regressed our progress and
        caused issues to spike, especially among our age group. That observation
        led to the creation of the AmpleMH organization. The AmpleMH
        organization uses the values come up by pioneer psychologist Adolf
        Meyer, who proposed in 1890 that the best way to prevent mental illness
        is to create good physical, emotional, spiritual, and mental habits that
        can shape the way we handle our power. By empowering students to take
        initiative in their own lives and create long-lasting habits easily, we
        believe that we can create a self-sustaining system where even external
        factors play less of a role in the mental health of teenagers in
        secondary institutions across the state and eventually, the world.
