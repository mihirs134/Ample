        This influx of statistics has not gone unnoticed by legislators and
        activists across the state, who have begun grassroots efforts to reduce
        the amount of stress that students in higher institutions face. However,
        not every plan made so far is foolproof and may not solve the problem
        long term.

      <h3> 1) Professional Mental Health Experts in the School</h3>
      <p>
        Bill A4075, released at the beginning of the 2022-2023 school year,
        mandates a threat assessment team in each school to protect students who
        might be thinking of hurting themselves or others. While the intent is
        clear—to keep students safe—their protection only comes when it might be
        too late for the student. On average, 45% of students who have already
        seriously thought about harming themselves will end up attempting
        suicide.

      <h3>2) Mental Health in Classrooms</h3>
      <p>
        In February 2020, this group was formed filled with representatives from
        schools, advocacy groups, companies, teachers, and parents to create
        resources for New Jersey high school students. They created the MTSS
        framework, which was then developed to become the curriculum for mental
        health in NJ high schools. While the resources are there, however, many
        districts can choose not to fund it or give it much attention, as it is
        merely a resource page. Students in certain communities may not be
        getting the education they need to better support their mental health.

      <h3>3) SEL Day</h3>
      <p>
        For the past couple if years, there has been the implementation of a day
        called SEL Day on March 10th, in which students are dismissed from their
        classes early to participate in activities that promote self-management,
        responsible decision making, and self-awareness. Activities done during
        the day include meditating, journaling, dancing, playing with dogs, and
        cooking, and were meant to serve as introductions to healthy coping
        mechanisms. While SEL day recieved a lot of positive feedback from
        schools across New Jersey, it was simply a 2-hour session. To build a
        good mental hygiene requires consistency and healthy habits besides just
        coping mechanisms. It’s a great start, but it cannot be all we do for
        our students.
